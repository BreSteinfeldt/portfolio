                        <h3>About Breanna:</h3>
                        
                        <p>After graduating college, I worked as a photographer for many fashion companies creating imagery for their websites and social platforms, later moving over into creative production.
                        As much as I loved working in the creative industry, I felt I wasn't utilizing all of my skills to their fullest potential. Software engineering is something I've always been interested in but never thought I could do.
                        I finally decided now is the time to start! I am so excited to work with other developers and continue to grow my knowledge of coding.</p>
                        
                        <p>Outside of web development my interests include music, art and reading!</p>
